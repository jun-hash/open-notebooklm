# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
The OSS NotebookLM with Voice Cloning app is an open-source application designed to generate synthetic speech from user-provided text and optionally clone voices using uploaded audio. The app provides a user-friendly experience for generating voices, playing back audio, managing history, and exploring community-generated voices in the future.

## Target Audience
- Developers interested in open-source voice synthesis projects.
- Users experimenting with text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning.
- Researchers and hobbyists exploring AI-driven audio generation.

## Key Features

### 1. Generate Voice
- **Description**: Generate synthetic speech from text input, with an option to clone a voice using uploaded audio.
- **Inputs**:
  - Text Area: Multi-line input for text (e.g., "Hello and welcome to Zonos.").
  - Voice Cloning Upload: Upload 10-60 seconds of audio for cloning.
- **Voice Options**: Fixed to "American Female" (default) and "American Male" (if cloned).
- **Output**: Playable audio file within the app.

### 2. Play Voice and Manage History
- **Description**: Play generated voices and manage history of generations.
- **Playback**:
  - Controls: Play/pause button, progress bar, duration (e.g., "00:00 / 00:34").
  - Metadata: Timestamp (e.g., "Mar 12, 2025, 01:19 PM") and voice.
- **History Management**:
  - History Tab: View all generated audio entries.
  - Actions: Like/dislike, download, delete.
  - Search: Filter by text, voice, or timestamp.
- **Default View**: Show recent entries first with expandable "More" option.

### 3. Explore Voices (Future Feature)
- **Description**: Allow users to explore voices generated by others (to be implemented last).
- **Interface**: Explore tab with text snippet, voice label, timestamp, user info, playback, and actions (like, comment, share).
- **Filters**: Search by text, voice, or user; sort by popularity, newest, or oldest.
- **Privacy**: Only publicly shared voices visible; use anonymized user IDs.
- **Scalability**: Add `is_public`, `likes_count`, and `comments` to `generated_voices` table; use pagination in `/api/explore`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can input text and generate audio with "American Female" voice.
- Users can upload 10-60 seconds of audio to clone as "American Male".
- Playback includes progress bar and duration display.
- History tab shows last 10 entries with management options.
- UI is responsive with a dark theme matching Zonos interface.
- (Future) Explore tab allows viewing public voices with search and sort.

## Technical Notes
- **Database**: Extend `generated_voices` with `is_public` (BOOLEAN), `likes_count` (INTEGER), `comments` (JSONB).
- **API**: Add `/api/explore` for public voices with pagination.
- **Frontend**: Use shadcn/ui <Tabs> for Explore tab integration.
